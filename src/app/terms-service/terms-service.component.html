        <p class="terms-bold">SERVICE DESCRIPTION</p>
        <p>
          This Service provides owners of food and drink establishments that permit their patrons  to pay for products at some future time, typically referred to as a "tab," to receive such payments electronically.  The Service also allows patrons of participating establishments to make such payments without waiting for a service provider to take such payment manually.  
          The Service is configured to charge a specific fee for such Services, and includes a gratuity.  All such fees are disclosed <a href="https://tbbbout.com">tbbbout.com</a> and are repeated here:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For users closing a tab with ACH/checking account - 3% fee is charged</li>
          <li>For users closing a tab with Credit Card or other electronic payment (e.g. VENMO, PAYPAL, APPLE PAY, GOOGLE PAY, etc.) - 6% fee is charged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may "close" an open tab at any time that we determine that the products have been provided and the participating establishment has closed or the patron has left the establishment (but in any event, we may close all tabs within 24 hours after they are opened; typically at 0400).
          We may include advertising on our mobile application that is used by patrons, and we may use the email, mobile number and other service addresses of patrons to communicate with them with relevant advertising, such as advertising of establishments that use the Service.

Unless set forth specifically in an Order Form, You agree to timely pay fees in U.S. dollars via check or money order (drawn on a US Bank, in readily available funds), wire/ACH transfer or via credit card. If You pay by credit card, You authorize Us to charge such credit card for all Services listed in the Order Form or Your Plan for the initial Subscription Term and any renewal Subscription Term(s) as set forth in Section 12.2. If you pay by wire/ACH, You authorize us to initiate the transfer in accordance with the payment schedule in the Order Form.

                    Overdue Charges. If any charges are not received from You by the due date, then at Our discretion, such charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid.  Our election not to charge late payment interest in one instance is not a waiver of our right to elect to do so in subsequent instances.
